# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Louise wants to start her own play called 'Fever'. Her play did not meet its target by a short amount. Now she wants to take a look 
at other fundraising campaigns for theatres and see how well they did based on certain factors. The two main factors we will be focusing on are 
"Outcomes based on Goals" and "Outcomes based by Launch date". For this, we will neet to work on the "Kickstarter" sheet which is contained in
Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx workbook. By extracting relevant information and making use of graphs and Pivot tables, we will help Louise in making
an informed decision regarding how she should proceed with the fundraising campaign.
